# Predicting Loan Defaults Using Machine Learning Model
### Saudi Digital Academy Capstone Project 

# Intorduction
One of the most important products offered by banks and lending institutions is a loan.
All banks are seeking to come up with effective business strategies for persuading customers to apply for loans.
They also seek to accept as many loan applications as possible in the hopes that everyone would be able to repay the loan at a fair interest rate. 
This is the most likely scenario in an ideal world. However, because we do not live in a perfect world,
some customers may behave negatively once their applications are approved, and they may not be able to return the loan as soon as we would want.


# Problem Statement
As a result, the problem statement is the unfavourable behaviour when a client fails to pay a loan, resulting in business losses.

# Business Solution
The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict and comprehend the previous customers' profiles in order to mitigate future loan default risk. We will use a dataset that includes data about credit applicants to develop and train a model that will assist in determining if the applicantâ€™s profile is suitable to enter the lending process; otherwise, it will be rejected.

# Business Value
To identify the features and behavioral patterns that contribute to future debt repayment problems.
Because loans are risky but also a valuable commodity for the business, utilizing a machine learning model 
can assist in identifying high-risk consumers by predicting the factors impacting payback. As a result, it helps lenders reduce their losses.
Predicting high-risk consumers enables businesses to strike a balance between risk and profit.
Additionally, it contributes to profit growth by boosting client access to loans.

# Dataset 
The data we use is available on Kaggle.com and also provided by the official website of Lending Club.
